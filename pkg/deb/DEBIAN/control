Description: cgroup-based eBPF per-process traffic redirection
 Route all traffic from a process (and its children) through an arbitrary
 network interface, with kill-switch semantics that drop packets instead
 of leaking when the interface goes down.
 .
 Features:
  - Kernel-level proxychains-like behavior using cgroup v2 and eBPF
  - Kill-switch: drops packets when the target interface is down
  - No fallback routing under any failure condition
  - Policy routing via firewall marks
